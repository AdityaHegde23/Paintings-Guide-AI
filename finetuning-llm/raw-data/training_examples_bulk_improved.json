Created in 1966, this work demonstrates the artist's commitment to figurative painting during Abstract Expressionism's dominance while addressing urgent social and political issues through classical artistic references. Golub's technique of scraping and abrading paint creates surface effects that suggest both archaeological fragment and contemporary urban decay, while his monumental scale creates overwhelming physical presence that confronts viewers with images of violence and struggle. The classical subject—battles between gods and giants—provides mythological framework for exploring contemporary conflicts and power relationships that characterized the turbulent 1960s. The artist's raw, aggressive painting style reflects his rejection of aesthetic beauty in favor of harsh political truth and social engagement. Notice how the work combines ancient artistic traditions with contemporary political consciousness, creating art that serves both aesthetic and activist purposes while challenging viewers to confront uncomfortable realities about power and violence. <END>"
